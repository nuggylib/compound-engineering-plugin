# Architecture Review Checklist

Verify these **before implementation**:

### Core Principles
- [ ] **Parity:** Every UI action has a corresponding agent capability
- [ ] **Granularity:** Tools are primitives; features are prompt-defined outcomes
- [ ] **Composability:** New features can be added via prompts alone
- [ ] **Emergent Capability:** Agent handles open-ended requests in the domain

### Tool Design
- [ ] **Dynamic vs Static:** For external APIs with full agent access, use Dynamic Capability Discovery
- [ ] **CRUD Completeness:** Every entity has create, read, update, AND delete
- [ ] **Primitives not Workflows:** Tools enable capability, don't encode business logic
- [ ] **API as Validator:** Use `z.string()` inputs when the API validates, not `z.enum()`

### Files & Workspace
- [ ] **Shared Workspace:** Agent and user work in same data space
- [ ] **context.md Pattern:** Agent reads/updates context file for accumulated knowledge
- [ ] **File Organization:** Entity-scoped directories with consistent naming

### Agent Execution
- [ ] **Completion Signals:** Agent has explicit `complete_task` tool (not heuristic detection)
- [ ] **Partial Completion:** Multi-step tasks track progress for resume
- [ ] **Context Limits:** Designed for bounded context from the start

### Context Injection
- [ ] **Available Resources:** System prompt includes what exists (files, data, types)
- [ ] **Available Capabilities:** System prompt documents tools with user vocabulary
- [ ] **Dynamic Context:** Context refreshes for long sessions (or provide `refresh_context` tool)

### UI Integration
- [ ] **Agent → UI:** Agent changes reflect in UI (shared service, file watching, or event bus)
- [ ] **No Silent Actions:** Agent writes trigger UI updates immediately
- [ ] **Capability Discovery:** Users can discover what the agent can do

### Mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] **Checkpoint/Resume:** Handle iOS app suspension gracefully
- [ ] **iCloud Storage:** iCloud-first with local fallback for multi-device sync
- [ ] **Cost Awareness:** Model tier selection (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)

**Address each checkbox explicitly in the architecture plan.**
