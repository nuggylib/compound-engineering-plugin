# Success Criteria

An agent-native application meets these criteria:

### Architecture
- [ ] The agent can achieve anything users can achieve through the UI (parity)
- [ ] Tools are atomic primitives; domain tools are shortcuts, not gates (granularity)
- [ ] New features can be added by writing new prompts (composability)
- [ ] The agent accomplishes tasks not explicitly designed for (emergent capability)
- [ ] Changing behavior means editing prompts, not refactoring code

### Implementation
- [ ] System prompt includes dynamic context about app state
- [ ] Every UI action has a corresponding agent tool (action parity)
- [ ] Agent tools are documented in system prompt with user vocabulary
- [ ] Agent and user work in the same data space (shared workspace)
- [ ] Agent actions are immediately reflected in the UI
- [ ] Every entity has full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Agents explicitly signal completion (no heuristic detection)
- [ ] context.md or equivalent for accumulated knowledge

### Product
- [ ] Simple requests work immediately with no learning curve
- [ ] Power users can push the system in unexpected directions
- [ ] User demand discovered by observing what they ask the agent to do
- [ ] Approval requirements match stakes and reversibility

### Mobile (if applicable)
- [ ] Checkpoint/resume handles app interruption
- [ ] iCloud-first storage with local fallback
- [ ] Background execution uses available time wisely
- [ ] Model tier matched to task complexity

### The Ultimate Test

**Describe a domain-relevant outcome with no specific feature built for it.**

If the agent figures out how to accomplish it in a loop — agent-native. If it says "I don't have a feature for that" — architecture is too constrained.
